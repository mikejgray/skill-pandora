    "installation": "This should self-install as a well-behaved Mycroft Skill, but here are some under-the-hood details. ### Dependency:  pianobar package This accesses Pandora via the excellent [pianobar](https://6xq.net/pianobar/) client for Pandora.  The skill installs the debian package: ``` apt-get update apt-get -y install pianobar ``` On Picroft and Mark 1, the skill will automatically set the appropriate drivers. For desktop there is typically no need for driver changes.  If you want to double check, manually do these steps: ``` echo default_driver=pulse > ~/.libao echo dev=0 >> ~/.libao ```",
    "troubleshooting": "Debug mode will allow pianobar to write to the mycroft-cli. There you can see a little bit more detail on what pianobar is doing under the hood.  Enable by saying \"Pandora debug on\"",
    "faq": "**Why isn't the song playing?** * You may be in paused mode.  Try saying 'resume Pandora' * Sometimes Pandora will deny access to their streaming service. This can be   resolved by just waiting for some time. I've noticed if i have multiple   devices playing Pandora at once. To see if this is your issue, turn on debug   mode, and you should see this message after invoking Pandora 'Error: Access   denied. Try again later.' **Why does it keep telling me to check my email and password.** * You should check your email and password.  Really.  Use a browser to log in   at [Pandora.com](https://pandora.com) to verify you are using the correct   credentials."
